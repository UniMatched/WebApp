# UniMatched - WebApp

![Logo](https://github.com/UniMatched/WebApp/blob/master/public/logo.png?raw=true)

Built using React (and in all seriousness, the README needs major work)

## Build status

- TravisCI:

    [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UniMatched/WebApp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UniMatched/WebApp)

- More in the future

## Requirements

- npm 6.14.8

## Installation

Just run `npm install` and you're good to go.

## Deployment

Should be automatic if Travis CI is set up correctly and we push to merge into the **master** branch

## Getting Started

For testing, run `npm start`. For production (on your local device) run `npm run build`. The rest will be dealt with through the CI/CD pipeline (i.e. pull requests to merge into origin/master)

## Testing

Run `npm test`
